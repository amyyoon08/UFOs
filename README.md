## Results:

- Link to the webpage : https://amyyoon08.github.io/UFOs/

## Summary :

- The drawback is that they don't have the dropdown function,it's hard to find which items are listed in the table.

- Recommendation 1: create a dropdown function so that the users do not need to check up the table before they enter into the input section.

- Recommendation 2: because some results might be a lot and the table is long, so that they can put the navigation button to help custom going back to the top of the back without scrolling up.
